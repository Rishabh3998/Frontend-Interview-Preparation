We have two types of components in React:

1. Class based components
2. Function based components

Q1. Explain class based components in React.
    -   Way to create components using ES6 classes.
    -   Older way to writing components compared to functional components.
    -   Can contain state and have access to lifecycle methods, which gets executed at various points 
        in a component's life cycle.

Q2: Explain constructor and super keywords over here.
    -   Constructor:
        -   Initializing state: It's used to initialize the component's state by assigning and initial 
            value to this.state.
        -   Binding event handlers or methods: It's also used to bind event handlers or methods to 
            component instance.
    -   Super:
        -   Used inside the constructor to call the constructor of the parent class. This helps us to 
            call the parent component and use the methods of parent class.
        -   Ensures that the component's props are correctly initialized and available within the component.

Q3: Explain the component lifecycle methods by adding them to this counter app.
    -   There are 3 phases in which component lifecycle works 
        -   Mounting
            -   When a component is initialized for the very first time.
            -   Lifecycle method used here: componentDidMount
        -   Updating
            -   Lifecycle method used here: componentDidUpdate
        -   Unmounting
            -   Lifecycle method used here: componentWillUnmount

Q4: Explain function based components and what are hooks? Explain any 2.
    -   const PhotoGallery = () => {
            const [photos, setPhotos] = useState([]); to manage state in a component
            useEffect(() => {}, []); used to manage side effects like fetching etc
            return (
                <div>Gallery</div>
            );
        }
    -   Hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state, lifecycle methods and other 
        React features previously available only in class components.

Q5: Convert this class based component to function based component and explain it.
