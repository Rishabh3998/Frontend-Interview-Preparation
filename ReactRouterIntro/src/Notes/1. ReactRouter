1. How we can create multiple page React applications?
    -   By using React Router DOM
    -   This external package helps us to do client side routing.
    -   Generally to create Multi page applications inside a vanilla web app we use anchor <a /> tag 
        to create routes in an application. Here we can use some other superpowers to do this routing 
        without loading a new page, In React app basically the pages are rendered dynamically using 
        components.
    -   React router intercepts the browser's request and injects the components and content which helps 
        us in this single page application for faster rendering without page refreshes.

2. Create a login form and onSubmit route them to a different page.

3. Design an error or 404 Not found route.

4. Give the example of a nested route in react router dom.

5. Create a protected route which redirects to a login page

6. How will you design a product page where user selects the spec and shares the link to other user, 
   it opens exact way as it was for original user? like a shareable link but a simple one For eg: 
   A shoe page which is a public page and some states can be updated using query params, like if 
   a shoe of size 7 is shared then if a different user will open that same link the size will be 
   auto-populate from query params ../../...?size=7
