    -   Doesn't have its own state or lifecycle methods.

3. What are Higher order components?
    -   Function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component.
    -   Used for code reuse, logic sharing, and adding additional functionalities to components.

4. What are pure components?
    -   Optimize the rendering performance of components by reducing unnecessary re-renders.
    -   In class based components we can use React.PureComponent to make any component a pure.
    -   In function based components we can wrap our component inside the React.memo(Comp1) which will
        make our component a pure component and no unnecessary re-rendering will happen in this component
        if its parent component get re-rendered.

5. What are controlled components?
    -   Value of the input fields are controlled by React through state.

6. What are un-controlled components?
    -   Input fields maintain its own state using the DOM.
    -   React doesn't control the value, but it can still interact with the input using refs.
