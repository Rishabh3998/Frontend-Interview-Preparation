React rendering process:

1. React is declarative in nature and not imperative.
    - This means that it does not allow you directly to interact with the DOM.
    - It uses something called VirtualDOM to interact with the DOM, so our actual DOM don't get 
      affected multiple times, therefore the performance gets increases.

2. Rendering process can be divided into 2 parts:
    - Render phase
        In this phase there are 2 types of renders:
            1. When are app is just loaded, or our component is loaded for the very first time,
               i.e. initial render.
            2. Second time is when the state gets update, a re-render happens of our component at 
               this time, this is the second type.

        PS: These are the two main causes when rendering happens, and the re-render only triggers
        by the state changes. Also when a parent component get re-rendered the child present inside
        also get re-rendered.
